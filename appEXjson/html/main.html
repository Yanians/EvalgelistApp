    <p>Potentially out of date PDFs containing the course syllabus for <a href="{{ main.syllabus431() }}">COMP431</a> and <a href="{{ main.syllabus531() }}">COMP531</a>.  The information on this page always superceeds any information in the syllabus documents.</p>

	<h2 class="ui dividing header">Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes</h2>
	<p>In this project-based course, students create multi-user Web applications utilizing many of the latest Web design technologies.  Students are involved in all aspects of application development including front-end and back-end programming.  Students learn and exercise industry best practices including test driven development and version control, and they explore modern Web structural frameworks.</p>
	<p>
		The desired learning outcomes for the course are
		<div class="ui bulleted list">
			<div class="item">
				<strong>Front-End Development:</strong> fundamental understanding of the hypertext transfer protocol; describe how dynamic web pages are served to clients; demonstrated ability to design hypertext markup language pages utilizing cascading style sheets; analyze a web application in terms of the model-view-controller architectural pattern; combine JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and custom implementations to create dynamic web pages.
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<strong>Back-End Development:</strong> fundamental understanding of various working components of a web server and how they interact; understanding of key database concepts including solutions for distributed database systems; create and query databases; analyze data transfer paradigms and implement selected data serialization techniques; compose various web services and custom implementations into a unified web application.
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<strong>Software Engineering Practices:</strong> describe the test driven development paradigm; utilize unit testing frameworks during code development; organize the implementation of software techniques through software design discussions.  Class time for the course includes descriptions of key topics, live demonstrations of technologies, discussions, and time for students to work on their individual Web applications.  By the end of the course, students develop a fully functioning multi-user Web application satisfying a collection of user and feature requirements, and gain the hands-on knowledge and experience to create forward-looking cutting-edge Web applications.
			</div>
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>The graduate section of the course contains the following additional learning outcome that will be achieved through paper and presentation: the evaluation and comparison of different web applications, web application designs, and web structural frameworks in regards to usability, efficiency, maintainability, and security.</p>

	<h2 class="ui dividing header">Prerequisties and Prior Knowledge</h2>
	It is strongly recommend that you either have taken the following courses or their equivalent:
	<div class = "ui list">

		</div>
	</div>
	<p>This is a project-based course and as such you are expected to be adept at installing software on your computer, navigating file systems, using an integrated development environment, etc.</p>

	<h2 class="ui dividing header">Required Text and Materials</h2>
	<p>There are no required textbooks for the class.  Instead, there will be a collection of suggested books that can be used to supplement lectures and online documentation.  Students are expected to have access to a computer to complete the assignments.</p>

	<p><a href="#/resources">Click here for resources</a>.</p>

	<h2 class="ui dividing header">Grade Policies</h2>
	<p>The course grade includes small group in-class exercises, individually contributed web development homework assignments, and a final project.Â  Additional grading policies will be posted on the course web site.</p>
	<p>The graduate section of the course additionally includes a written paper and presentation along with user feedback surveys.</p>
    <p>There are no make-up assignments and late work will not be accepted in this course without approval conditional on notification prior to the due date of any assignment.</p>

	<h2 class="ui header">Absence Policies</h2>
	<p>
	A portion of the grade for the class will be in-class exercises which are due at the end of the day.  If a student will knowingly miss a class session they are expected to notify the instructor at least 1 day before the class meeting and will be confirmed to submit the in-class exercise late.
	</p>

	<h2 class="ui header">Rice Honor Code</h2>
	<p>In this course, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook at <a href="http://honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/">http://honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/</a>. This handbook outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.</p>
	<p>The in-class exercises may be performed in small teams or two or three students.  This work is shared work that all students of the team may use for their class assignments, but should not be shared with other members of the class.</p>
	<p>All submitted homework is expected to be the result of the student's individual effort.  Outside of the in-class exercise contributions, portions of code presented in class or posted on the class website, class assignments should be completed solely by student submitting the assignment.  Students are encouraged to discuss with their peers techniques for completing the assignments, but all code should be written by the submitting student and not copied or refactored from sources not approved by the instructor, and in those cases should be properly attributed.</p>

	<h2 class="ui dividing header">Disability Support Services</h2>
	<p>If you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should make sure this documentation is on file with <a href="http://dacnet.rice.edu/~dss/" target="_blank">Disability Support Services</a> and talk with the instructor to discuss your accommodation needs.</p>

	<h2 class="ui dividing header">Syllabus Change Policy</h2>
	<p>This syllabus is only a guide for the course and is subject to change.  The latest syllabus information for the course will always be available <a href="#">HERE</a> on the course web site.</p>
