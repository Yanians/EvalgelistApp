In this assignment you will begin developing your backend server and complete 
the implementation of your frontend web application.
Your frontend webapp from this assignment will be reviewed by your peers 
to provide you user feedback.</p>

<p>Separations of concerns instructs us to
divide our application into separate front and back end processes.  
In this way our application is modular, can be selectively scaled, 
and we have indepdence to change each at their own pace.
In this assignment we will separately host our frontend and backend applications on Surge and Heroku respectively.</p>

<p>The remaining implementations missing from our frontend web app are the ability
to upload articles with and without images, 
register new users, edit a user's profile including uploading a new profile avatar, 
adding a new followed users, and removing followed users.
For our first implementation of the backend server we will implement
the headlines and articles endpoints, and provide stubs for a collection ofthe others.</p>

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->

<h2>Frontend</h2>

<p>In the previous assignment we implemented the ability for users to login to our webapp,
and pulled from the dummy server the user's status headline, their profile avatar,
their feed of articles, and their list of followers.
Now we add the missing functionality to create a fully functioning 
social networking web application frontend.
</p>
<p>
For uploading images on articles as well as to upload profile avatars, see <strong><a href="data/api.html#upload" target=_blank>this</a></strong> section of the API page.
</p>

<p>
For this assignment we will use Selenium and write end-to-end tests to validate functionality of our web app.  
Serve your frontend site locally and have Selenium run against your locally running frontend
site similar to the inclass exercise.
The required tasks for your end-to-end tests are listed in the requirements section below.
</p>

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<h2>Backend</h2>

<p>
We will have separate frontend and backend applications.  
Your frontend app is currently talking to my dummy server, and eventually we want it talking to your server.  But there's a lot of work to get that done!
</p>

<h3>Setting up your backend server</h3>

<p>Getting started you should do your development for your backend in it's own directory separate from your frontend and separate from your inclass submission directory.
Because we use git to communicate to Heroku you will want a separate git repo for your backend server -- if you "git init" inside your regular git repo used
for inclass submissions then you will create a git submodule.  If you go this route you are responsible for assuring everything works.  It is far easier to have a separate git repo just for your backend server.  Recall you can submit *any* git repo for your assignments so long as it has the appropriate subdirectory.
</p>

<p>Most of the backend has already been developed through inclass exercises.
"npm start" should spin up your server at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> and
you can use your browser, a browser extension (such as Advanced REST Client or Postman), or use curl on the commandline to 
test your server.</p>

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<h3>Stubbing the Backend</h3>

<p>Stubs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub" target=_blank>"pieces of code used to stand in for some other programming functionality."</a> 
For this assignment we will create stubs for all of the desired endpoints of our API.  
After the stubs are created, then we will implement selected functionality 
in this assignment.

<p>Here is the recommended breakout by endpoint for each source file in your <em>backend</em> server
<table>
     <tr><th>endpoint</th><th>verbs</th><th>source file</th></tr>  
     <tr><td>/login</td><td>POST</td><td>auth.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/logout</td><td>PUT</td><td>auth.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/register</td><td>POST</td><td>auth.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/password</td><td>PUT</td><td>auth.js</td></tr>
     <tr class="double"><td>/articles</td><td>GET, PUT</td><td>articles.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/article</td><td>POST</td><td>articles.js</td></tr>
     <tr class="double"><td>/headline</td><td>GET, PUT</td><td>profile.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/headlines</td><td>GET</td><td>profile.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/email</td><td>GET, PUT</td><td>profile.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/dob</td><td>GET</td><td>profile.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/zipcode</td><td>GET, PUT</td><td>profile.js</td></tr>
     <tr><td>/avatars</td><td>GET</td><td>profile.js</td></tr>     
     <tr><td>/avatar</td><td>PUT</td><td>profile.js</td></tr>     
     <tr class="double"><td>/following</td><td>GET, PUT, DELETE</td><td>following.js</td></tr>
</table>
Start by creating "stubs" for all endpoints.  A stub returns dummy data, for example
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
// this is profile.js which contains all user profile 
// information except passwords which is in auth.js

const profile = {
        headline: 'This is my headline!',
        email: 'foo@bar.com',
        zipcode: 12345,
        avatar: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/DWLeebron.jpg/220px-DWLeebron.jpg',
    }

const getHeadlines = (req, res) => {

    // we will want middleware to supply this value
    // for now we provide a default
    if (!req.user) req.user = 'Scott'

    const users = req.params.users ? req.params.users.split(',') : [req.user]

    // this returns only one headline, but we want to send
    // an array of all the requested user's headlines

    res.send({ headlines: [ 
        { username: users[0], headline: headlines[users[0]] } 
    ] })

    // Implement the logic to return headlines for all requested users
    // each user has a default value.  Only the "req.user" value ever changes.
}

module.exports = (app) => {
    app.get('/headlines/:users*?', getHeadlines)
}
</pre>
The API for the endpoints is the same as for the dummy server 
(i.e., this way we don't need to change any of the frontend code).  That api is found here
<center><a target="_blank" href="data/api.html#api">Backend API list of endpoints</a></center>
Note you do <em>not</em> need to create a stub for <code>GET /sample</code></p>

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<h3>What to implement</h3>

<p>Just as for the previous assignment, we will employ test driven development as we implement
our backend server.  Therefore start by writing unit tests for each unit of functionality
we desire to implement, and then implement that functionality, thereby satisfying the test criteria.
You might have these tests already written from inclass exercises.</p>

<p>Use <a target=_blank href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp431/sample/RiceBookServer/">
https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp431/sample/RiceBookServer/</a> as an example Node application
with testing enabled.  We used this example for the inclass backend testing exercise.</p>

<p>For this assignment, write tests for, and then implement, the following endpoints 
(see the <a target=_blank href="data/api.html#api">API page for specification</a>)</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>GET /headlines</code></li>
    <li><code>GET /headlines/sampleUser</code> (should always return a value)</li> 
	<li><code>PUT /headline</code> (updates value in memory for default user, so a GET call returns new value)</li>
	<li><code>GET /articles</code> (should return at least 3 articles)</li>
    <li><code>GET /articles/id</code> (where id is a valid article id as well as when it is an invalid article id)</li>	
	<li><code>POST /article</code> (test that adding an article increments the article id, validate the contents of the new article)</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not yet have a database for storing the information
the server needs to provide to the client.  Therefore we keep
all data in memory.  The only data that can change is the data
for the currently logged in user.  This user has some default
user name ('Scott' in my example code above).
I recommend you have a profile object in memory that you 
use for updating the headline.  Subsequent calls
of PUT /headline and GET /headlines should return updated
values.  I.e., PUT /headline with payload "Hello" will update
the in memory profile object and then GET /headlines will return
me "Hello".  GET /headlines/foo will return a default value for
the user "foo".
</p>

<p>Make the zipcode and email endpoints also persistent, i.e., PUT /zipcode should update
the zipcode value returned by GET /zipcdode.  PUT /avatar is just a stub.</p>

<p>Similar to the headline, we'll have an array for articles.  
We should start with 3 hardcoded articles in this array,
you can use the sample data provided from 
<a href="https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/sample?q=3" target=_blank>the dummy server</a>.
When a new article is added, it should be added to this array.  
An article has the following schema:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
const article = {
	_id: int,
	author: string,
	text: string,
	date: new Date(),
	comments: [ ]
}
</pre>
A new article will arrive with only the text in the payload.  The timestamp is the current time on the server,
the author is the currently logged in user (some default value), 
and the _id is a unique value determined by the server (the length of the article array would be sufficient for now).  
The response to <code>POST /article</code>
is an array of the newly added article, i.e., with it's timetsamp, author, and id values supplied.
The newly added article will automatically be available in the list of all articles
returned by a call to the <code>GET /articles</code> endpoint.
For now you can supply whatever username you want, just as for the headlines endpoint above.
</p>

<p>
Check that your backend works.  For example you can perform the following commands (either using curl as shown here or Advanced Rest Client or similar)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl https://ricebookserver.herokuapp.com/articles
# you should receieve 3 articles
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "text": "My first message!" }' https://ricebookserver.herokuapp.com/articles
# you should get a complete article back with _id.  I assume the value is 12345, let's verify getById works:
curl https://ricebookserver.herokuapp.com/articles/12345
# you should get your new article again
curl https://ricebookserver.herokuapp.com/articles
# you should get 4 articles now
</pre>
<p>We will use an automated test similiar to these commands to check the functionality of your backend.</p>

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<h3>Deploying your Back-End</h3>

<p>When you have completed the implementation of the required pieces of your
backend server you are ready to publish your server to Heroku.
Note that the git repo sent to Heroku should only contain
your backend application, not any inclass exercises or other homework assignments.
Be sure you have <code>node_modules</code> excluded from your git repo but by adding it to the gitignore file 
(Heroku will automatically install these libraries for us because they are in our package.json file).  
In the example below I have named my server "ricebookserver" -- you will want
to pick your own name, or omit and Heroku will supply a name for you</p>
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
git init
heroku create ricebookserver
echo web: node index.js > Procfile
echo node_modules >> .gitignore
echo npm-debug.log >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore Procfile package.json index.js
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push heroku master
</pre>
<p>Heroku should automatically recognize that we have a NodeJS application.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Similar to before, create a file <code>README.json</code> that has contents similar to what is below 
(we will read this programmatically so make sure you follow this style and it is proper json)</p>
<pre style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em;">
{ 
     "netid": "sep1",
  "frontend": "https://ricebookapp.surge.sh",
   "backend": "https://ricebookserver.herokuapp.com"
}
</pre>
<p>replace "ricebookapp" and "ricebookserver" with the names of your frontend and backend applications, and replace "sep1" with your netID.</p>

<h3>Frontend</h3>

<p>We finish the implementation of the frontend of our webapp while continuing to use the dummy server as 
a backend data store.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your frontend is deployed on Surge</li>
	<li>All of the functionality in the previous assignment is assumed to be working in this assignment</li>
	<li>Profile view: upload new profile avatar</li>
	<li>Main view: <a href="data/api.html#upload" target=_blank>add a new article with both text and a picture</a></li>
    <li>Main view: edit articles authored by the logged in user</li>
    <li>Main view: add a new comment on an article</li>
    <li>Main view: edit comments authored by the logged in user</li>
	<li>Your completed and published frontend webapp will be viewed by your peers</li>
</ul>

<h3>End-to-End Tests</h3>

<p>Your end-to-end tests will run against your web app running on your localhost.  Here are the tasks for your end-to-end test</p>

<ul>
	<li>Register a new user</li>
	<li>Log in as your test user [Note: the dummy server has special logic for these test users]</li>
    <li>Create a new article and validate the article appears in the feed</li>
    <li>Edit an article and validate the article text has updated</li>
	<li>Update the status headline and verify the change</li>
	<li>Count the number of followed users</li>
	<li>Add the user "Follower" to the list of followed users and verify the count increases by one</li>
	<li>Remove the user "Follower" from the list of followed users and verify the count decreases by one</li>
	<li>Search for "Only One Article Like This" and verify only one article shows, and verify the author</li>
	<li>Navigate to the profile view, Update the user's email and verify</li>
	<li>Navigate to the profile view, Update the user's zipcode and verify</li>
	<li>Navigate to the profile view, Update the user's password, verify a "will not change" message is returned</li>
</ul>
<p>Include a XML juit report of your end-to-end tests: <code>e2e/results.xml</code>
 -- note that you are responsible for the file contents to receive credit for your tests.
</p>

<h3>Backend</h3>

<p>Your backend server will be hosted on Heroku, we will use a grading robot to validate
your implementation, so be sure you test your deployed server before you submit.
</p>

<ul>	
	<li>Your backend server is deployed on Heroku.</li>
    <li><code>GET /headlines</code> returns headline message for default user</li>
    <li><code>GET /headlines/:user*?</code> returns a headline message, one for each user in url</li>
	<li><code>PUT /headline</code> updates default user's headline</li>
	<li><code>GET /articles/</code> returns all articles, 3 hardcoded and any additional that are added</li>
	<li><code>GET /articles/:id</code> returns the article with the requested id if it exists, none otherwise</li>
	<li><code>POST /article</code> adds a new article to the list of all articles.  Returns the newly added article</li>
	<li>Unit test that PUT headline updates the headline message, i.e., GET, PUT to change the value, GET to verify it was changed</li>
	<li>Unit test adding an article, i.e., GET and count the current number of articles, POST a new article, 
        verify you get back what you added, then GET again and count the number verifying it increased by one</li>
    <li>Profile endpoints email and zipcode will update the inmemory stored values.</li>
	<li>The other endpoints on the API page all function and return stubbed data according to the API definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inlucde a JUnitXML report of your backend unit tests.
Using mocha add "-R xunit" and then pipe the results
to a file, e.g., <code>results.xml</code> -- note that you are responsible for the file contents to receive credit for your tests.
</p>

<h2>What to submit</h2>

<p>Your frontend and backend applications are each
within their own separate repository.  
You will submit each separately.  It is your
responsibility to correctly submit your frontend to the frontend submission selection
and the backend to the backend submission selection on the grading site.
Because the backend is hosted on Heroku, there is no "hw" directory in that repo.
The README.json file should be same in both submissions.</p>

Your frontend submission
<pre>
hw{{vm.hwid}}-frontend  [this directory is optional]
|-- .babelrc
|-- .eslintrc
|-- .gitignore
|-- README.json
|-- package.json
|-- coverage
|   `-- ...
|-- e2e
|   |-- ...
|   `-- results.xml
...
</pre>

Your backend submission might look like this (notice no root directory)
<pre>
.
|-- README.json
|-- .gitignore
|-- index.js
|-- mocha.opts
|-- package.json
|-- Procfile
|-- results.xml
`-- src
    |-- auth.js
    |-- articles.js
    |-- articles.spec.js
    |-- following.js
    |-- profile.js
    `-- profile.spec.js
</pre>

<p>Note that I have placed the headline endpoints in <code>profile.js</code> as a look ahead to 
the way in which we will be persisting the data: the headline of a user will be stored along
with their other profile information.</p>
