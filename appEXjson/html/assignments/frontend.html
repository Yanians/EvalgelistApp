In this assignment you will partially implement and test the frontend of your web application.  
We start with our draft frontend application that contains three views integrated
into a single page application (SPA) 
<ul>
  <li>landing page with registration and login</li>
  <li>main page with articles, followers, and headline message</li>
  <li>profile page for a user to upload a new profile picture and edit their user data</li>
</ul>
Remember that when tackling any large task our best approach is to divide and conquer.  For 
this assignment there are two major portions:
<ol>
	<li>Writing unit tests of the desired functionality and mocking the dummy server endpoints.</li>
	<li>Implementing logic for our site and connecting to the dummy server.</li>
</ol>
<a target=_blank href="https://jsbin.com/jeliroluni/edit?js,output">
Here is an example that should help you get started communicating with the dummy server.</a>
</p>

<h3>Test Driven Development</h3>

<p>We will exercise test driven development 
	instead of writing the implementation of our web app first and testing later.
Therefore before we implement anything we will first write tests for our functionality.  In this
way the desired behavior will drive our implementation and design.
Start by writing Mocha unit tests for the desired behavior and 
execute the test suite as we develop.
</p>

<h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p>Every user interaction point should be validated.  Most user interactions involve
making an AJAX call to the server to update data.  In our test environment we will
not want to contact the real server, and therefore want to intercept the AJAX requests 
and provide our own mocked response.
</p>
<p>
For our first test we will simulate the user entering a new status message, which will
be sent to the server for persistence.  We completed a similar task as part of an inclass exercise.
Note that in the inclass exercise we were not using React.  Therefore we had to insert values into
the text inputs before executing the updateHeadline function.  
In your React+Redux application we test
separately the React view and the Redux action.</p>

<p>We want to mock calls to fetch which is our engine for AJAX.  If you are using Karma
to run your tests, then webpack can alias isomorphic-fetch
to mock-fetch.  Otherwise if you use Mocha directly
then we need to substitute in the runtime mock-fetch
for the fetch coming from isomorphic-fetch, which is 
supplied by node-fetch.  In the following I provide you
an example of doing this using <code>mockery</code></p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
import { expect } from 'chai'
import mockery from 'mockery'
import fetch, { mock } from 'mock-fetch'

import * as profileActions from './profileActions'

...

let Action, actions
beforeEach(() => {
  if (mockery.enable) {
	mockery.enable({warnOnUnregistered: false, useCleanCache:true})
	mockery.registerMock('node-fetch', fetch)
	require('node-fetch')
  }
  Action = require('./actions').default
  actions = require('./actions')
})

afterEach(() => {
  if (mockery.enable) {
	mockery.deregisterMock('node-fetch')
	mockery.disable()
  }
})

it('should update the status message', (done) => {
  
  // the result from the mocked AJAX call
  const username = 'sep1test'
  const headline = 'A new headline!'

  mock(`${url}/headline`, {
  	method: 'PUT',
  	headers: {'Content-Type':'application/json'},
  	json: { username, headline }
  })

  // review how complex actions work in Redux
  // updateHeadline returns a complex action
  // the complex action is called with dispatch as an argument
  // dispatch is then called with an action as an argument

  profileActions.updateHeadline('does not matter')(
  	fn => fn(action => {
	  expect(action).to.eql({ 
	  	headline, type: actions.UPDATE_PROFILE
	  })
	  done()
  	}))

})
</pre>
<p>
We use mockery to substitute mock-fetch in place of node-fetch.
node-fetch is called by isomorphic-fetch.  The "fetch" we
use in resource comes from isomorphic-fetch.</p>
<p><strong>The order is important!</strong>  <code>require</code>
contains a cached map of name to JavaScript module.  When we <code>require('./actions')</code>
it proceeds to load <code>isomorphic-fetch</code> which then loads
<code>node-fetch</code>.  If we have not already applied the mock, then the "real"
module is loaded and we cannot override it.  Instead we apply the mock first
so that when node-fetch is later called, our mock is supplied instead.</p>
<p>
Above we have mocked the resource calls to the dummy server
and supply a hardcoded result to the client code.  (The client
code is updateHeadline, which is the code we are testing.)
</p>
<p>
See below for the list of unit tests that we require in this assignment and refer to the <a target="_blank" href="data/api.html#api">API</a> for the return types for each service call.
Instructions on getting started with the dummy server are at the top of the API page.
</p>

<h4>Behavior Implementation</h4>

<p>After you have implemented all of the tests listed below, 
we need to implement the desired functionality so that the tests
pass.  In this way we also assure that all of the code we write is covered by our test cases.
I.e., we should get high marks for code coverage with no extra effort and no need to later refactor our
code so that it will be testable -- this again is a benefit of test driven development.
The list of functionality is provided below.
</p>

<p>Once we are completed with the connections to the dummy server
 we can manually verify that our site works as expected, we will have confidence in this because we already tested and implemented
the headline and followers functionality, the site should therefore be fully functional in these two areas.  Perform
live user testing by logging in with your account, changing your headline message, and then logging in with your test user
account and verify that the headline message is indeed persistent.  
</p>

<h3>For next time...</h3>
<p>
In the next assignment we will implement the missing functionality of editing and commenting
articles, as well as uploading articles with images, or changing the profile avatar.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Use Chrome as your standard supported browser.  Whereas you can use any browser you like for development, 
	your assignment will be accessed using Chrome by the grading staff and therefore it behooves you that it works.
</p>
<p>Host your submission on Surge.  
Include the URL in a <code>README.json</code> file as before.  The deployed version of your code on Surge may be used during grading.  
Therefore after you make your submission, please do not re-deploy to the same Surge domain until the next assignment.</p>

<p>Remember separation of concerns and write DRY modularized code.</p>

<h3>Unit Tests</h3>
<p>Use Mocha and Karma to test your application.  Note that in principle we only test "our" code and not "framework" code.  Therefore we 
do not need to test that Redux's <code>dispatch</code> function behaves as advertised, or that ReactDOM properly
mounts cmponents.  Instead we only want to test our specific business logic that we wrote.</p>
<p>You should have tests for each of the following, with the "it" descriptions as given</p>
<ul>
	 <li>Validate actions (these are functions that dispatch actions)<ul>
		  <li>resource should be a resource (i.e., mock a request)</li>
		  <li>resource should give me the http error</li>
		  <li>resource should be POSTable</li>
		  <li>should update error message (for displaying error mesage to user)</li>
		  <li>should update success message (for displaying success message to user)</li>
		  <li>should navigate (to profile, main, or landing)</li>
	  </ul></li>
	  <li>Validate Authentication (involves mocked requests)<ul>
		  <li>should log in a user</li>
		  <li>should not log in an invalid user</li>
		  <li>should log out a user (state should be cleared)</li>
	 </ul></li>
	 <li>Validate Article actions<ul>
		  <li>should fetch articles (mocked request)</li>
		  <li>should update the search keyword</li>
	 </ul></li>
	 <li>ArticlesView (component tests)<ul>
		  <li>should render articles</li>
		  <li>should dispatch actions to create a new article</li>
	 </ul></li>
	 <li>Validate Profile actions (mocked requests)<ul>
	      <li>should fetch the user's proile information</li>
		  <li>should update headline</li>
	 </ul></li>
	 <li>Validate reducer (no fetch requests here)<ul>
		  <li>should initialize state</li>
		  <li>should state success (for displaying success message to user)</li>
		  <li>should state error (for displaying error message to user)</li>
		  <li>should set the articles</li>
		  <li>should set the search keyword</li>
	      <li>should filter displayed articles by the search keyword</li>
	 </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the above tests validate the logic code, i.e., your Redux
code, not your React code.  This implication is supported
if we have simple React components for our view.  The idea being
that complex React components would require testing, and testing
the virtual DOM is more difficult than testing simple functions.
There are only a couple of component tests listed above, where
you will want to validate that the component is properly
rendered and the desired functionality is present.</p>

<h3>Implemented Functionality</h3>
<p>Below are the functional requirements for this assignment.  
All of the data mentioned below comes from the dummy server.
There is <strong>no hardcoded data</strong> in your frontend.
The currently logged in user's headline, profile picture, collection of articles,
list of followers, and profile information all come from the dummy server.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Landing view: Register a new user, but new users cannot log in</li>
	<li>Landing view: User can log in with netID and three-word-passphrase, 
		if successful then redirect to the Main view, otherwise inform user of 
		incorrect login</li>
	<li>Main view: ability to update headline for user using dummy server, update is persisted to server</li>
	<li>Main view: list of articles from server with newest article first</li>
	<li>Main view: add user to followed users list (add that user's articles to feed)</li>
	<li>Main view: remove user from followed users list (remove that users's articles from feed)</li>
	<li>Main view: each article has a list of comments displayed (you may want to show/hide them as in my solution or some other means to make it user friendly)</li>
	<li>Main view: search bar filters displayed articles by author or body, but not date or article id</li>
	<li>Main view: ability to add new text-only articles by posting to server</li>
	<li>Profile view: update on server the user profile email and zipcode after validation</li>
	<li>Profile view: update on server the user password after validation, note that new password will not persist on server</li>
</ul>
<p>The functionality we are not implementing relates to image uploading and editing or commenting on articles,
	which will be done in the next assignment.
</p>

<h2>What to submit</h2>

<p>Be sure that you are not submitting or checking in node_modules, look for the .gitignore file
in your repo, you can copy <a href="https://github.com/skotep/comp431/blob/master/.gitignore"
target=_blank>this</a> one if you want.

<p>Include your test coverage results in your submission.
Additionally create a XML junit report that demonstrates your tests ran and did not fail.
Karma should create the <code>coverage</code> and <code>junit</code> directories for you automatically.
</p>

<p>Your submission <em>might</em> look like this:</p>

<p>The important thing about the above structure is that each portion of the web app has it's own directory.  
We try to be modular in our design patterns.  You are not required
to follow this directory structure exactly, but you are required to have a modular layout.  
What is important is that there <em>is</em> structure and that the structure makes good extensible and maintainable sense.
