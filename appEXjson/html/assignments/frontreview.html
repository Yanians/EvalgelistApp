<em>This assignment is for students enrolled in COMP531.</em>
<p>There is nothing to turn in for this assignment.</p>
<p>
In this assignment you will review the frontend web applications generated by your peers
and provide user feedback surveys for them.  User feedback can be extremely
valuable when designing and redesigning an application.  Afterall, if users do 
not like the interface, then they are less likely to use it.  
</p>
<p>
Additionally,
the skill of writing good feedback is one that we <em>all</em> need improvement on.
We want to clearly articulate our ideas and convey our findings to other
individuals.  Therefore take care in what you write and make sure that it is 
of the <u>highest level of your writing</u>.  Proof read your comments.  Review them.
Revise them.
</p>
<p>
Good feedback is descriptive and actionable.  Remember that we are providing
feedback to help the designers of the site make the site better so that we
will have a better experience using the site.  Therefore be specific
in your feedback.  Explain specifically what your opinions are and provide
suggestions and recommendations for how the site might be changed to better
suit your needs of use.
</p>
<p>
The survey is non-persistent until you submit.  This means if you refresh 
the page what you have written may not remain.  Additionally your <b>login cookie
is only valid for one hour</b>, so if you elapse this one hour what you write
may be lost if you click submit after the expiration.  Therefore either write
fast (but remember to review) or you may find it useful to write your comments
in a separate text editor and then paste them into the survey.
</p>
<p>Remember to take this survey seriously.  Your responses will be graded
for their candor and usefullness as constructive feedback.  In addition,
that your provide critical evaluation and comparison of the site.
</p>
<p>Complete your surveys online at
<a href="http://webdev-rice.herokuapp.com">http://webdev-rice.herokuapp.com</a> and clicking on Survey in the middle section of the page.
</p>
<p>Then click on <strong>"Complete a Front-End Web App Review"</strong>
<p>You should spend no more than about 15 minutes or so on each website.  
Therefore this assignment should take you about 2 hours to complete.</p>
</p>
<p>You are asked to review 5 sites.
If a site is not available then you should
click "Next Survey" to cycle through the sites to pick one that is available.
You may pick which ever 5 you want -- you will be graded on your responses irrespective of the sites you choose. 
Take your time and demonstrate your critical thinking: 
You should be writing about three sentences for each answer, this will likely take you about 15 minutes or so on each website.  
Therefore this assignment should take you just over an hour to complete.</p>
