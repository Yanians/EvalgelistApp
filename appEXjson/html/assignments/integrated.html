In this assignment you will integrate your frontend and backend web applications.
</p>
Currently the backend server only supports headlines and articles, and these are
stored as inmemory data structures.  Heroku requires our server to reboot every day.
Therefore articles and headlines are not persistant day to day.
Our solution for this is to use a database to persist state.  
We will use MongoDB as our database of choice for this assignment.
</p>
<p>In addition to adding a persistent document store, we
will implement the bulk of the functionality for our backend server.
The only thing we do not implement in this assignment is the handling of uploading images.
Therefore we continue to accept only text-only articles and do not implement 
the functionality of <code>PUT /avatar</code> in this assignment.
</p>
<p>
The final piece of this assignment is to direct our frontend webapp to use our backend
server instead of the dummy server, thereby integrating our social networking application.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>There are several key pieces to this assignment, and these pieces can 
be taken in any order.  I divide up the problem into:
<ol>
  <li>Authentication (login, logout, new user registration, password changing)</li>
  <li>Integrating headlines and articles with mongo</li>  
  <li>Edit articles, add comments, edit comments</li>
  <li>Profile editing of email and zipcode</li>
  <li>Add, remove, and list followed users</li>
</ol>
<p>All will require a working document store for persistence.  It therefore behooves you
to setup your mongo instance first.  After that you can take the above pillars
of the assignment in any order.</p>

<p>
Follow these <a target=_blank href="data/database.html">database instructions</a> 
for setting up your MongoDB instance and connecting it to your backend server
if you have not already completed this as part of an inclass assignment.
</p>

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<h3>Aside on Middleware</h3>

<p>Node is all about middleware.  Middleware are functions inserted between the server and the endpoint handler that have three arguments, request, response, and next, which is a "pointer" to the next piece of middleware or endpoint.  In <code>index.js</code> we see examples of functions in the request-reponse pipeline with two arguments, request and response.  These are endpoints -- they do not have a <code>next</code> function to pass on to.  A middleware function might look like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
function isLoggedIn(req, res, next) {   
    var id = req.cookies['sessionId']    
    ...
    req.user = ...
    return next()
}
</pre>
<p>To use this middleware we can either <code>app.use(isLoggedIn)</code> &quot;globally&quot; on all of our endpoints (bearing in mind that <code>app.use()</code> is applied in order) or on individual endpoints like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
    app.put('/logout', isLoggedIn, logout)
</pre>
<p>we can chain together as many pieces of middleware as we want.</p>
<p>Here <code>isLoggedIn</code> is placing on the request object the currently logged in user information.  This
way the currently logged in user will be accessible from downstream endpoint functions.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to add the isLoggedIn middleware to ensure that users are properly logged in before 
using your service.  If you work on the other endpoints before authentication, then you can still have
isLoggedIn, but it just won't do anything other than provide a default user on the request object.</p>

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<!-- ******************************************************************** -->

<h2>Implementing Endpoints</h2>

<p>Even if we have not yet implemented fully the <code>isLoggedIn</code>
middleware, you should stub the function and add it to all routes.
This will assure that all requests are made by authenticated clients.<p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
// this is profile.js which contains all user profile 
// information except passwords which is in auth.js
moodule.exports = (app) => {
    app.get('/headlines/:users*?', isLoggedIn, getHeadlines)
}
</pre>
The API for the endpoints is the same as for the dummy server 
(i.e., this way we don't need to change any of the frontend code).  That api is found here
<center><a target="_blank" href="data/api.html#api">Backend API list of endpoints</a></center>
<p>We will implement all of the endpoints except <code>GET /sample</code> and
<code>PUT /avatar</code>.  Additionally, we still only accept new articles with text only, no pictures.
</p>
<p>
If we were doing TDD then we would write tests for each function before we write the implementation.  
Given that you have some experience in writing tests, 
I recommend you do this, but it will not be a requirement
for this assignment.  Additionally, we already have a working frontend with end-to-end tests 
which can serve us well in testing our backend functionality.  (But again, unit testing the 
backend separately is the preferred approach.)
</p>
<p>Previously our headline and article endpoints used an in-memory data structure
for storage.  Now we change these to use our mongodb document store.
Follow the inclass slides and exercises as examples for how to do this.
I would perform the implementation file by file, i.e., all of <code>profile.js</code>
then <code>following.js</code> then <code>article.js</code> and finally <code>auth.js</code> --
but you can implement in any order you desire.
<p>

<p>During implementation I would make use of either the command line program <code>curl</code>
or a browser plugin such as Advanced REST Client to test my server during development.
Alternatively you could use your already working frontend webapp (pointing it to you locally
running backend server) to perform the requests.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>Users must be authenticated to use the backend.  They authenticate by supplying their
username and password in a payload to <code>POST /login</code> which if successfully
authenticated will return a cookie.  The cookie will be passed on all subsequent requests
until the cookie expires or the user makes a request to <code>PUT /logout</code> which deletes the cookie.</p>

<p>Before we can log a user in we need to either hardcode an account in the mongo document
store, or implement new user registration.  
Note that we will use salted passwords for our authentication and we will write the implementation
of salting and hashing ourselves (you are <strong>not</strong> to use third-party modules that 
do all of this for you such as the popular <code>session</code> module).</p>

<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>
The register endpoint will add two new documents to your mongodb, one to the
users collection with a username, a randomly created salt, and the hash of the user's salted password.
The other is the user's profile information, including a default status message, an empty list of followed
users, and a default picture.</p>
<p>
Something to consider: We <em>could</em>
make an Object with behavior in which case <code>new User()</code> would create a user
and then it could have a function <code>getHash()</code> but this is not necessary.
I would just implement a separate function that given a password and salt provides the hash.
This function will then be called during new user registration, when a user logs in, and when
a user changes their password.
</p>

<h4>Salting</h4>
<p>
The salt should be a random string, perhaps a combination of the user's username and the current time, 
maybe even the hash of that combination.
You are allowed to use the <code>md5</code> library or if you prefer you can use <code>bcrypt</code> which
is a popular encryption library.  
For either library use "<code>npm install ... --save</code>" so that the dependency
is stored in your <code>package.json</code> file.
</p>

<h4>Sessions</h4>
<p>
Whereas the register endpoint saves new documents to mongo, 
the login endpoint looks up a record in the mongo database based on the logging in user's username.
Then using the salt from the record, compute the hash from the user's password 
and compare with the hash from the record.
If they match then create a session for the user.  
Store the session in a map from session key to user.
Here is an example that attempts to create unique session keys for users
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
// this is in auth.js
const sessionUser = {}
const cookieKey = 'sid'

function login(...) {

    // get the record from the database by username
    const userObj = getUser(...username...)

    // "security by obscurity" we don't want people guessing a sessionkey
    const sessionKey = md5(mySecretMessage + new Date().getTime() + userObj.username)
    sessionUser[sessionKey] = userObj

    // this sets a cookie
    res.cookie(cookieKey, sessionKey, { maxAge: 3600*1000, httpOnly: true})
</pre>
<p>we store the session key in a cookie for the user.  Note that the sessionUser
map really should be a <em>least recently used</em> (LRU) map, otherwise it is a potential memory hog!
Later we will migrate this to use a distributed memory store to alleviate this difficulty.  For now
just use an inmemory map as shown here and don't worry about LRU.</p>

<h4>isLoggedIn</h4>
<p>Now we can update the <code>isLoggedIn</code> middleware to grab the cookie from the request (if it exists),
and lookup in sessionUser the corresponding user, adding it to the request object for the downstream endpoints.  
If there is none, or the cookie did not exist, then the user is not logged in and we should respond with a 401 Unauthorized.
</p>
<p>When a user logs out, remove their sessionKey from the sessionUser map and clear/delete the cookie in the response object.</p>



<h2>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</h2>

<p>The browser has a same-origin policy.  Which means it will only allow javascript to transfer
data from the same origin.  I.e., I visit site A and can run JavaScript that accesses data from site A, but it cannot access data from site B.  By access data I mean make an AJAX request.  The browser will only allow cross-origin resource sharing if the other origin (site B) allows for it.  
See the lecture on security to visualize what it going on.  
From that lecture you should recognize that it's your backend that needs to supply the headers in it's response to the client.  
Look again at that lecture to find what response headers should look like.</p>

<p>The frontend and backend have different origins.  When running locally you might have the 
frontend running on port 8080 and the backend served up on port 3000.
Therefore we need to enable CORS for the AJAX calls to complete without the browser rejecting them.  
You'll want to create a middleware function that adds these response headers to every request.  
<em>If</em> you were to only use it on some requests, then you could put the middleware in the middle of an endpoint call:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
app.get('/articles', enableCORS, getArticles)
</pre>
but we want to add middleware to <em>all</em> calls, and therefore instead have 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
app.use(enableCORS)
</pre>
<p>where <em>enableCORS</em> is a middleware function that <em>you</em> 
write (do <u>not</u> use third party middleware for this part of the assignment).  
See the lecture on security for the inclass exercise enabling CORS.</p>
<p>You should enable CORS globally: whatever origin requests data, you should allow a response.  I.e., 
<u>you should not hardcode a domain.</u></p>

<h3>Sending text-only articles from the frontend</h3>

<p>Note that our <code>POST /article</code> endpoint will only be accepting
text at the current moment.  I.e., no picture uploads.  Therefore the frontend
application needs to be modified to <em>not</em> send formData.  For example,
if we already had a method <code>addArticle</code> 
then we would rename it <code>addArticleWithImage</code> and make a new <code>addArticle</code>.
This way we can easily switch back to the formData upload for the final assignment
when image uploading is enabled on the backend.</p>

<h3>Integrating with the Frontend</h3>

<p>
Now that your server has enabled CORS you should be able to point your frontend at your backend.
In your frontend webapp, change the server URL from the dummy server address to your locally running
backend server (i.e., http://localhost:3000).  Verify that your frontend is functional (e.g., logging in and out).
Verify that your backend is functional (check for error messages in the console).  
When you are satisfied with the backend functionality, push your backend to Heroku.  
Now adjust your locally running frontend to access your deployed backend on Heroku.  
Again, verify that your frontend is functional. 
</p>
<p class="warning">
Do NOT push your updated frontend to Surge using the same app name as for the previous assignment.
Do NOT push your updated backend to Heroku using the same app name as for the previous assignment.
</p>
<p>Your "working" frontend talking to the dummy server is being used for reviews.
So as to not disrupt the review process (i.e., you would have unhappy users) 
create a <em>new</em> Heroku application name for your backend and use a different
url for your frontend.  
For Heroku, you can do this by typing "<code>heroku create newappname</code>" be sure
to change "newappname" to either your desired name for your application
or leave blank and Heroku will assign you a name.</p>
<p>After you have your new frontend app setup locally, push it to Surge.  
Now verify that your newly deployed frontend is functional with your deployed backend.
Your old frontend app should be unchanged and continue to talk to the dummy server.
</p>
<p>
Notice in all of this that we make iterative changes step-by-step and do not jump to a fully deployed+deployed 
setup.  In this way we control our rollout and can identify problems and their source as we go along.
