<strong>Note the due date for this assignment</strong>
</p>

<p>
In this assignment you will deliver your multi-user web application.  
The objectives are:</p>
<ul>  
  <li>generate a unified feed of articles for a user based on their followed users</li>  
  <li>add a redis caching store for session management</li>  
  <li>permit users to upload profile avatars and articles with pictures</li>
  <li>add a third-party authentication option with account linking</li>
</ul>

<!-- ********************************************************************** -->

<h2>A User's Feed</h2>

<p>Each logged in user has a feed which is the collection of their articles and their follower's articles.  
When the user requests <code>GET /articles</code> we therefore need to return this joined set.  A poor 
algorithm would be the following</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
const userObj = getUser(req.user)
const articles = [userObj.username, 
    ...userObj.following].reduce((o, user) => 
        o.concat(getArticlesByAuthor(user)), [])
</pre>
<p>This is bad because it adds all articles for all time
to the result set (articles) and additionally makes multiple requests to the database.
Instead we want one query to the database that retrieves articles for all users and only those
articles that are recent.  I.e., we would prefer something like</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
const userObj = getUser(req.user)
const usersToQuery = [ userObj.username, ...userObj.following ]
const articles = getArticlesByAuthors({ authors: usersToQuery, limit: 10 })
</pre>
<p>where the query will preferentially grab the 10 most recent articles by all of the users in the array.
In this way the client will make one request to get the user's feed and it will be relatively small in size.
To retrieve the next set of articles after the initial 10, we would implement pagination on the query.
You'll want to look at the MongoDB/<a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html" target=_blank>mongoose</a> documentation,
and write only one query to the database, and return only the desired data.  The sorting of articles (most recent first) can be
done either by MongoDB (better) or by the server (not terrible).</p>
</p>


<h2>Session Management</h2>

<p>When a user logs in we register
with them a session identifier.  This session id is stored in a cookie for the user,
and in a map from session id to user on our server.  This way all subsequent
requests from the user will be identifiable as them without requiring them
to log in again.</p>
<p>Following an inclass exercise, move the in-memory sessionId-to-user map 
to a Redis caching store.  In this way if we have multiple backend
servers, they will share the memory of the session id lookup and not
require users to login multiple times.</p>
<p>Run these commands to add Redis (i.e., following the inclass exercise)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev
heroku plugins:install heroku-redis
npm install redis --save
heroku config
</pre>
<p>
From the last line you can find your Redis URL.
Here is some code to get you started using Redis:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
if (!process.env.REDIS_URL) {
    process.env.REDIS_URL = 'redis:// put your redis url here'
}
const redis = require('redis').createClient(process.env.REDIS_URL)

// This sets the key-value pair (sid, userObj)
redis.hmset(sid, userObj)

// This gets the value corresponding to the key sid -- it is an async call
redis.hgetall(sid, function(err, userObj) {
  console.log(sid + ' is mapped to ' + userObj)
})
// these commands might be outdated -- check the redis documentation!
// userObj must be an object, not a string or an array.
</pre>
<p>To log into your Redis server and flush the cache (i.e., delete all entires)
to the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
heroku redis:cli --confirm &lt;APPNAME&gt;
redis> keys *
redis> flushall
</pre>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://redis.io/commands" target=_blank>full list of commands</a> for Redis.</p>

<h2>Persistent Picture Uploads</h2>

<p>When we upload a picture to the server it will be stored on disk.  
This we can potentially consume a lot of disk space if we're not careful
about limiting user uploads etc.  Additionally, local storage on Heroku is not persistent to dyno reboots, i.e., 
after you repush your code, your Heroku dyno will reboot and any locally uploaded files 
will not be available on the new dyno.  Therefore local storage of images is not ideal.</p>
<p>
MongoDB has a document limit size of 16 MB.  This means for most uploads we could probably
store them as documents in MongoDB.  However, for images this is inconvenient because our
backend server much first pull the document from MongoDB and then serve the image to the frontend.
It would be much better if images were readily available to the frontend and the frontend
could pull the images directly from a datastore.
</p>
<p>
In a lecture I showed how we can use Amazon's S3 to store blobs of data, such as images.  
S3 is a great service, and in fact S3 is used by Heroku for storage.  But outside of a free trial
period, S3 is not free.  Instead, we will use Cloudinary, which has a free tier,
to persist uploaded pictures.
</p>
<p>We need a few modules: 
Multer is a node.js middleware for handling <code>multipart/form-data</code>, which is exactly what we have for uploading files.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
npm install cloudinary multer --save
heroku addons:create cloudinary:starter
heroku config
</pre>
<p>
The addon for Cloudinary requires billing information for Heroku -- again you will not be charged
if you stay in the free tier.  If you can not get Cloudinary to work through the Heroku plugin
you can go to their site and register directly.  We need the Cloudinary url, which is what
the last line above provides.
</p>
<center>Download the <a href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp431/sample/uploadCloudinary.js">Cloudinary starter</a> 
presented in class.</center>
<p>
Follow the in class exercise to demo the functionality.  Then implement the <code>PUT /avatar</code> endpoint
and validate it works using your frontend.
You also need to implement adding articles with text and images.  
You will use the same middleware <code>uploadImage</code> for both uploads.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Authentication</h2>

<p>Following an inclass exercise, add an option for third party authentication.  It is
your pick as to which third party you partner with.  It can be Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc, 
any OAuth or OAuth2 provider should work.  
You should use either Request (OAuth) or PassportJS (OAuth or OAuth2) as middleware for authentication.</p>

<p>On your landing page next to the register and login buttons have an additional button
to login with the third party.  When a user logs in this way you do not know what user
account they are linked to in our system.  Perhaps you can try looking up the user by their
email address.  Nevertheless we will need some way to distinguish third part authenticated
users from normal password users.  Therefore add an additional field to your User model
to capture this.  When a user logs using third party authentication, if you do not already
have a user record for them (i.e., by email or by looking up username+third party)
then create a new record in the document store with no salt, no password, but with a username
and with an identifier for the third party.
E.g., I might have username="sep1" and auth="rice" to signify this is the Rice OAuth service for the netid sep1.
Notice that we may now have username conflicts between "sep1" registered with a password and "sep1"
with OAuth.  Perhaps we would link these accounts together?  But doing that without
user confirmation can be problematic (what if the user owning sep1@rice does not own sep1 on our site?).
Therefore we might instead choose to uniquly identify the username, e.g., "sep1@rice" 
to prevent username conflicts with an already registered sep1 on our site.
This way a user can always log in with third party auth and still use our site as if they 
were a regular user.</p>

<h4>Account Linking</h4>
<p>
But perhaps the accounts do belong to the same user?
</p>
<p>
Add to your profile page a way for a user to link their accounts together.
For example, on the profile page there would be a "Link Account" button 
which if they are logged in using the third party, they would be able to login with a username 
and password for our site.  If they are logged into our site, then it would direct them
to login with the third party.  After the user has logged in the second time,
we merge the two accounts together.
This means we need to search to see if there was already the second User record
and delete it if it exists.  I.e., if I logged in as sep1 and then as sep1@rice
but then wanted to link the accounts together, then you would delete the sep1@rice record,
and merge the followed users together.
For the sep1 record you would add the additional auth information, 
perhaps the field would be <code>auth = [ rice: sep1, google: skotep, facebook: scott ]</code> so that I can 
link multiple third party accounts.  Later when a user logs in using the third party, 
we need a MongoDB query that searches this new auth field to find the account in addition
to searching by username.
</p>
<p>If we can link accounts then we should also allow users to unlink accounts, which should be straightforward.
In this case we would only delete the OAuth account, we would not generate a new User record for it, i.e.,
if I unlink my @rice then auth becomes: <code>[ google: skotep, facebook: scott ]</code> but
no sep1@rice User record will be generated separately.</p>
