<p>
In this assignment you will develop the frontend design of your web application.  
(In a following assignment you will implement the full functionality of the frontend.)
</p>

<p>Our social networking web application will consist of three main views.  When an un-logged-in
user navigates to our site they will be greeted with the "landing" page, where they can log in
or register a new account.  This page we partially developed in the first assignment.
After a user has logged in, they will be taken to the "main" page which contains the 
user's feed (consisting of the most recent articles by the user and the users the current user is following), 
a list of the users the current user is following, and a link to the "profile" page which allows a user
to change their profile picture and other pertinent information.  These last two pages we began developing
in the second assignment.
</p>

<p>In this assignment we integrate the three views
into a single page application (SPA) using React and Redux for navigation.
</p>

<p>
Using raw CSS or a CSS Framework such as Bootrap, Foundation, SemanticUI, or others, beautify your
web app.  Your three pages should have a unified look and feel.  You most certainly will want
a navigation area common to your pages which will contain, for example,
the currently logged in user's displayName and allow for the user to access 
their profile page from the main page, as well as a log out button.
</p>

<p>We also add more features to our main page.  
We started with the user's feed, which is a collection 
of cards, each of text or both text and an image.  
For this assignment we no longer require the images to change and therefore do not want the pause/resume buttons.
We need a button to log the user out of our application.  
We should be displaying the user's profile picture somewhere on the page, and in addition to
this, each user will have a "status" headline.  The status headline for the current user should be
prominently displayed.  The headline is a short one line message, such as "I'm learning JavaScript!" as
opposed to an "article" which can be longer in length and include posted images.
As mentioned above we will have a list of users being followed.
This list will have user profile pictures, the display names (or account names) of the followed users,
and the status headlines of the followed users.  For now these should all be hard coded, and we only need
a few examples of each (i.e., 3 or more).  The goal is to get an idea of what the final working page will look like.
</p>

<h2>React and Redux</h2>

<p>Using React for the views, refactor your three separate html files, index.html, main.html, and profile.html,
into a SPA.  This means index.html will contain a div for the application to mount 
and a script tag for the JavaScript application bundle.  For navigating between 
the three views you may use React Router but a more simple approach is to have 
a "location" state variable and then selectively display a Component based on the value.  
For example,
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
if (location == MAIN_PAGE) {
	&lt;Main .../&gt;
} else if (location == PROFILE_PAGE) {
	&lt;Profile .../&gt;
} else {
	&lt;Landing .../&gt;
}
</pre>
and "links" in your app will dispatch updates to the location state variable.
</p>
<p>
The file structure of your web app should have separate directories for each "section" of your application,
see below for an example file structure.
Remember to make your files small, ideally with only a single Component within, or at least a single concern.
</p>

<p>
As you being transforming your three pages into a React site, focus on the navigation
of your site from page to page before implementing the details of each page.  
To help with the transition to pulling data from the future backend server,
put your dummy data in json files that are loaded into your application.
For example, suppose we create a file <code>initialItems.json</code> for the initial todo items
in the todo app:</p>
<pre>
{
	"todoItems": [
	    {"id": 0, "text": "This is an item", "done": false},
	    {"id": 1, "text": "Another item", "done": false},
	    {"id": 2, "text": "A third item?", "done": true}
	]
}
</pre>
Then in our <code>reducers.js</code> file we would load
that data:
<pre>
const initialItems = require('./initialItems.json')

const Reducer = (state =  {
	nextId: 2,
	todoItems: initialItems.todoItems,
	visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL'
}, action) => {
</pre>
<p>In this way we separate our concerns between business logic and data.
	You can grab sample articles from 
	<a href="https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/sample?q=10" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>

<h3>Landing View Requirements</h3>

<p>The "landing" view is the first view users will see when they navigate to your site.
	It should have the following</p>
<ul>
	<li>Registration fields to make a new account as described in the previous assignment.
	After validation (ala the previous assignment), the submit button navigates to the main view</li>
	<li>text fields for a previously registered user to enter their account name and password</li>
	<li>A log in button.  The button validates that there is text in the account name
	and password fields and then navigates to the main view.  The validation is for presense
	of text nothing more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Main View Requirements</h3>

<p>The "main" view contains a collection of cards.  
	These cards will be referred to as "articles."  
	For now we continue to use hard coded text and images
	for each article as we did in the previous assignment.  Each card should 
	have text or both an image and text.
</p>
<p>In addition to a collection of cards displayed on the main view as 
	the feed (which can be single or multi-column), there are the 
	following requirements</p>
<ul>
	<li>Button or link to navigate to the profile page</li>
	<li>Button or link to log out, which navigates to the landing page (index.html)</li>
	<li>Each card has text, or text and an image (images do not change periodically, no pause/resume buttons)</li>
	<li>There should be at least 8 cards, at least four have images.</li>
	<li>Each card has a button to leave a comment.  But the button currently does nothing.</li>
	<li>Each card has a button to edit the article.  But the button currently does nothing.</li>
	<li>A search box, that filters the displayed articles by text or author, but not date or article id</li>
	<li>There is an area for a user to add a new article, this can be an editable div, a textarea, or some other tag.  But the area currently does nothing on user input.</li>
	<li>There is a button to "post" the article which adds the article to the top of the displayed feed and clears the text area.  The new article is not persistent.</li>
	<li>There is a button to "cancel" writing the new article.  This button should clear the new article text.</li>
	<li>There is a button to upload an image (Hint: input type='file').  But the button currently does nothing after a file is chosen.</li>
	<li>The user's display name and profile picture are shown.  These can be hard coded.</li>
	<li>The user's status headline is shown.  The status headline can be hard coded.</li>
	<li>There is a button to update the user's status headline.  The button should update the status headline, but on refresh there is no persistence required, i.e., it can return to the original value.</li>
	<li>Sidebar listing at least 3 followed users.  The list should include a picture, name, and status headline for each user.  These can all be hard coded.</li>
	<li>Text field and button to add a user to the following list.  For non-empty text, the follower is added to the sidebar with an arbitrary (i.e., hard coded) image and headline message</li>
	<li>Each followed user has a button to unfollow which removes that user from the list</li>
</ul>

<h3>Profile View Requirements</h3>

<p>The "profile" view is where a user can update their profile picture and account information.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The current display name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and zipcode are displayed</li>
	<li>There are fields to update each user piece of user information along with a field to update the user's password.  Birth date can not be changed.</li>	
	<li>Show the user's current profile picture</li>
	<li>There is a button to upload a new profile picture.  But the button currently does nothing after a file is chosen.</li>
	<li>There is a button to update the user's values based on user input.  The button validates
	each of the fields that are changed and then updates the displayed value as in the previous assignment.</li>
	<li>There is a button or link to navigate back to the main page</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the views should be styled and "look good" -- your site will 
be visited and commented on by members of the class.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p><a target="_blank" href="data/wireframe.pdf">Here's a wireframe</a> for a site that satisfies the above requirements.  Remember this is just an example,
your solution does not need to look like this one.</p>

<h2>Publication</h2>

<p>
In adition to submitting your repo for grading, for your site to be reviewed by other members of the class you will need to publish it.  
We will be using Surge for hosting our web applications (it's free).
</p>
<p>We will use npm tooling for accessing surge (although you can upload directly as well).  Hereâ€™s an example package:
<a href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp431/sample/surge-example.zip">surge-example.zip</a> which
is hosted at <a hef="http://chivalrous-credit.surge.sh/" target="_blank">http://chivalrous-credit.surge.sh/</a>.
</p>
<p>If surge is not already in your package you will need to install it <code>npm install -S surge</code>
To deploy to surge:
<pre>
# deploy to surge
npm run deploy
</pre>
<p>Verify the look and feel and functionality of your site as hosted on Surge.  
Be sure to update your site on Surge as the final step of your submission.  
You should not further update your Surge
deployment after you have submitted your assignment.
Note that if your site is not available when students go to
review it then you will not receive any feedback.</p>

<p>Again, the purpose of this assignment is to consolidate the layout, look, and feel of
the three pages of our web application.  Other than simple navigation
and some validation which was mostly completed previously, 
there is no actual functionality to much of the site.</p>

<h2>What to submit</h2>

<p>Include in your hw{{vm.hwid}} submission a file named README.json that has the following
contents (replaced with *your* values of course)</p>
<pre style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em;">
{
  "netid": "sep1",
  "frontend": "https://ricebook.surge.sh"
}
</pre>
<p>Be sure that you submit a correct json file with these keys.</p>

<p>Your submission directory should look something like this (note that there is no .git directory and no node_modules directory)</p>

<pre>
hw{{vm.hwid}}

</pre>

<p>The important thing about the above structure is that each portion of the web app has it's own directory.  
We try to be modular in our design patterns.  You are not required
to follow this directory structure exactly, but you are required to have a modular layout.  
What is important is that there <em>is</em> structure and that the structure makes good extensible and maintainable sense.
</p>

<p>Here is my example solution site <a target=_blank href="https://ricebook.surge.sh/">https://ricebook.surge.sh</a>
you can log on to this site using<br/><code>{ username: "guest", password: "visitor" }</code> </p>

<p>Note that if you begin to have a <em>lot</em> of styles then you are welcome
to split your CSS up into separate files: <code>main.css</code>, etc.  Remember
that all three of your pages should have the same "look and feel" which is why one stylesheet makes sense.
